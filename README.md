This is a personal learning project built with C#, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages,
and SQL Server. The goal of this app is to explore and understand the fundamentals
of building web applications using the Razor Pages framework, along with basic CRUD
operations and database integration.

It is not intended for production use, but rather as a hands-on exercise to improve
my skills in:
ASP.NET Core Web Development
Razor Page architecture and routing
SQL Server integration with Entity Framework Core
Building and managing data-driven applications
